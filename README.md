My personal variable types in Golang.
All of which is just an extension and made it simpler to create objects and converting them to other types

<i> **warning**: this is meant for my own resuble utilities, that i use a lot, and making it available for me to import via go modules</i>

- Map   (map[string]any with extra features: access by json path, encode-to-from json/msgpack)
- Array (making array methods similiar to js array)
- Bytes ([]bytes, with value conversion methods)
